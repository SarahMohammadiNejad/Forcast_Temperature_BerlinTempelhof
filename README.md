# Forcast_Temperature_BerlinTempelhof
In this project, you analyse temperature time series from  Berlin Tempelhof and we create a short-term temperature forecast for Berlin Tempelhof.
- Get and clean temperature data from www.ecad.eu
- Build a baseline model for trend + Plot and inspect
- Build a baseline model for seasonality + Plot and inspect
- Extract the remainder + Test the remainder for stationarity
- Model time dependence of the remainder using an AR model
- Compare the statistical output of different AR models
- Model Validation: Cross-Validation + Split train - test
- Predicting Temperature for the after.
